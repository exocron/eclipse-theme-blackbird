Eclipse Blackbird Theme
=======================

A dark theme for Eclipse, inspired by, and designed to match with, [the Xfce Blackbird theme](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Blackbird). Requires the [Eclipse 4 Chrome Theme plugin](https://github.com/jeeeyul/eclipse-themes).

Combine with [Eclipse Color Themes](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=plugin) and a dark theme like Obsidian for maximum awesomeness.

Installation
------------

1. Drag this link onto your running Eclipse workspace: <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=339851" class="drag"><img src="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/modules/custom/marketplace/images/installbutton.png"></a>
2. Navigate to `ECLIPSE_DIR/configuration/net.jeeeyul.eclipse.themes`, where `ECLIPSE_DIR` is your Eclipse installation directory
3. Replace `user-presets.xml` with the one from this repository. If you have other user presets you would like to keep, you will have to merge the XML of the two files.

You can find the presets under the far-right button in the Chrome Theme preference page.
